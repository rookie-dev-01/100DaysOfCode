1. In CSS : on defining style classes: the last ordered style class takes higer precedence. 

Note: It doesn't matter which order the classes are listed in the HTML element.

However, the order of the class declarations in the <style> section is what is important. 
The second declaration will always take precedence over the first. 
Because .blue-text is declared second, it overrides the attributes of .pink-text

2. #ID style takes precedence over the .class style

3. body-style values gets overridden with the class-style attributes 

4. Inline style elements overrides everything else. 

5. !important; - adding this will make sure that this property sustains no matter what styles are been added on top of this. 

6. TRANSFORM - tag used to transform the elements - scale, move, rotate, skew, etc.
